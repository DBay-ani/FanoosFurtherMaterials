For a citable version of any of the material found exclusively / specifically
in this repo, you might find the upload at Zenodo useful (find the one called 
"Further Material for Fanoos [...]" at 
   https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=owners:253927 
); it provides a bibtex citation 
export and DOI. Further, the content on Zenodo is immutable, so I cannot 
alter or takedown any material that appears there after it is uploaded (barring
extreme cases that fit narrow guidelines established by that organization, and
which require permission and oversight from those governing Zenodo - even then,
upload timestamps most likely would remain uneffected).
