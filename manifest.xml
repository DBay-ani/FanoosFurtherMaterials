This file contains a list detailing other Fanoos related work. We do not 
promise that this list is comprehensive. For instance, at a minimum, it
does not have the ArXiv write-up of Fanoos listed comprehensively. Our intent
in this repo is to list and provide as much content relating to Fanoos as
possible that (1) has been publicly communicated (2) is not yet archived
elsewhere; as we detail in the next paragraph, an aim of this manifest is to
provide a guarantee that content has not changed beyond the date of being
posted here / listed in previous git commits in this repo. In other words, the
aim is to create an accurate and accountable record of otherwise unarchived
mass communications regarding Fanoos and related work.

TO CONFIRM THE SHA512 HASH AND FILE SIZE OF THIS MANIFEST, BOTH IN
PRESENT AND PREVIOUS VERSIONS, SEE THE APPENDIX OF THE WRITE-UP AT:
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12453.pdf
Since ArXiv does not allow removal, overwriting, or modifications or submitted
write-ups, the hash and files size reported allows one to check whether we
have modified this manifest since the time of the ArXiv upload. As a result,
this also allows one to check that none of the files listed have been modified.
If the file was modified, then its hash and/or file size would (almost 
certainly) change, which would not match this manifest - unless we modified the
manifest, but then the hash and/or size of this manifest would (almost 
certainly) change, which would then fail to match ArXiv - and we do not have the
ability to modify ArXiv. This creates a chain of trust, where one can trust 
that we did not modify content. While theoretically meaningful modifications are
possible without changing the hash and file size, making such changes is
largely infeasible since (1) reversing sha512 hashes is hard (at least for us, the
authors), usually requiring non-trivial resources (time/computer power) to find an 
effective attack, (2) even if we succeed in finding a file with the same hash 
and size, the new file would not necessarily contain changes that are meaningful or 
desirable.

The slides sent to the symposium organizers for a backup presentation in case
video presentations had technical difficulties. We were informed that the 
slides would be posted online by the organizers after the event. To the best of
our knowledge, at the time of writing this note 
( 02:53:37 UTC 22 Sep 2020 ), these slides are not yet available through
the symposium.

(Poster) Fanoos: Multi-Resolution, Multi-Strength, Interactive Explanations for Learned Systems
</title>

</fileName>
<fileDescription>
Poster submitted to the ICAPS-XAIP 2020 workshop. After checking, both the 
poster submitted and the png provided online by the workshop are the same (so
there was no additional compression or meta-data added, etc.). A pdf file of the
poster was also submitted to the workshop organizers, but they preferred the
png; while later the decision may be reversed, at the time being I see little
utility in providing the pdf here as well. In case it proves useful for the
record, the sh512sum of the pdf file was 
a447c4456e5eb7090274946d5c1557b93393cee1f3c6f1f53a3ea8df2a1333635cb2c40a69c4e77950cc717a2c7c27fdcd3fb6cf786eac945bd885bf3cafc636
and the file size was 716934 bytes.

This poster was displayed and discussed during the second poster session of
the workshop.

Fanoos: Multi-Resolution, Multi-Strength, Interactive Explanations for Learned Systems
</title>
<fileName>
icapsXaip2020/bayani_xai2020.pdf
</fileName>
<fileDescription>
Paper listed online for ICAPS-XAIP 2020 workshop. After checking, it is 
identical to the one provide for IJCAI-XAI 2020, which is to be expected since
the ICAPS-XAIP presentation was arranged in collaboration with the sibling
workshop, IJCAI-XAI. I list the pdf here for the record's sake, despite the
duplication, though I might reverse this decision later.

Fanoos was shown as a poster presentation at ICAPS-XAIP; the paper is provided
online by ICAPS-XAIP to facilitate reference by workshop attendees, etc. In
contrast, at IJCAI-XAI, a paper talk regarding Fanoos will be given. This is
to say that the involvement and delivery at the two venues is not repetitive.
