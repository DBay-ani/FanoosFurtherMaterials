This file contains a list detailing other Fanoos related work. We do not 
promise that this list is comprehensive. For instance, at a minimum, it
does not have the ArXiv write-up of Fanoos listed comprehensively. Our intent
in this repo is to list and provide as much content relating to Fanoos as
possible that (1) has been publicly communicated (2) is not yet archived
elsewhere; as we detail in the next paragraph, an aim of this manifest is to
provide a guarantee that content has not changed beyond the date of being
posted here / listed in previous git commits in this repo. In other words, the
aim is to create an accurate and accountable record of otherwise unarchived
mass communications regarding Fanoos and related work.

TO CONFIRM THE SHA512 HASH AND FILE SIZE OF THIS MANIFEST, BOTH IN
PRESENT AND PREVIOUS VERSIONS, SEE THE APPENDIX OF THE WRITE-UP AT:
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12453.pdf
Since ArXiv does not allow removal, overwriting, or modifications or submitted
write-ups, the hash and files size reported allows one to check whether we
have modified this manifest since the time of the ArXiv upload. As a result,
this also allows one to check that none of the files listed have been modified.
If the file was modified, then its hash and/or file size would (almost 
certainly) change, which would not match this manifest - unless we modified the
manifest, but then the hash and/or size of this manifest would (almost 
certainly) change, which would then fail to match ArXiv - and we do not have the
ability to modify ArXiv. This creates a chain of trust, where one can trust 
that we did not modify content. While theoretically meaningful modifications are
possible without changing the hash and file size, making such changes is
largely infeasible since (1) reversing sha512 hashes is hard (at least for us, the
authors), usually requiring non-trivial resources (time/computer power) to find an 
effective attack, (2) even if we succeed in finding a file with the same hash 
and size, the new file would not necessarily contain changes that are meaningful or 
desirable.

ijcaiXai2020/fanoosPresentation_IJCAI_XAI_2021.pdf
</fileName>
<fileDescription>
This file contains a PDF version of slides shown for the presentation of Fanoos
at IJCAI-XAI 2020; the presentation started in the latter part of hour3 day8 
month1 year2021 (UTC) and ended no later than the first few minutes of 
hour4 day8 month1 year2021 (UTC). The presentation was a slide-deck; it has been
exported to a PDF here for easier inclusion in this repo. Prior to exporting 
the PDF, some minor adjustments were done to ensure all intended content was 
viewable. For example, animations in the original presentation often occluded 
content; effected slides have been split into multiple parts in this PDF,
showing the appearance before and after the animation. The pdf was generated
on minute43 hour6 day11 month4 year2021 (UTC)

While many talks during the workshop were recorded, the presentation for Fanoos
was not since consent was not provided by the speaker for a recording to be made
and/or shared.

<fileDescription>
Poster submitted to the ICAPS-XAIP 2020 workshop. After checking, both the 
poster submitted and the png provided online by the workshop are the same (so
there was no additional compression or meta-data added, etc.). A pdf file of the
poster was also submitted to the workshop organizers, but they preferred the
png; while later the decision may be reversed, at the time being I see little
utility in providing the pdf here as well. In case it proves useful for the
record, the sh512sum of the pdf file was 
a447c4456e5eb7090274946d5c1557b93393cee1f3c6f1f53a3ea8df2a1333635cb2c40a69c4e77950cc717a2c7c27fdcd3fb6cf786eac945bd885bf3cafc636
and the file size was 716934 bytes.

This poster was displayed and discussed during the second poster session of
the workshop.

Fanoos: Multi-Resolution, Multi-Strength, Interactive Explanations for Learned Systems
</title>
<fileName>
icapsXaip2020/bayani_xai2020.pdf
</fileName>
<fileDescription>
Paper listed online for ICAPS-XAIP 2020 workshop. After checking, it is 
identical to the one provide for IJCAI-XAI 2020, which is to be expected since
the ICAPS-XAIP presentation was arranged in collaboration with the sibling
workshop, IJCAI-XAI. I list the pdf here for the record's sake, despite the
duplication, though I might reverse this decision later.

Fanoos was shown as a poster presentation at ICAPS-XAIP; the paper is provided
online by ICAPS-XAIP to facilitate reference by workshop attendees, etc. In
contrast, at IJCAI-XAI, a paper talk regarding Fanoos will be given. This is to
say that the involvement and delivery at the two venues is not repetitive.

Essentially an improved and far extended version of the write-up pointed to in this

Note that the name of the document - which makes reference to day7 month6 
year2019 - refers to which day the document (as separate from the earlier
writings ) was created and began being written. The document was write by 
D Bayani, who later emailed it to the people listed in the document on minute50
hour23 day12 month6 year2019 (UTC). This document is not provided in this
repository; see the item in this manifest with UUID 
3d4f8f56-b134-424b-8e05-d8fc7ed019fa for a redacted version of this write-up.
Note that this document contains result-types that were not adopted in Fanoos
(such as visual plots and "task agnostic" exploration of spaces), in addition to
efforts that did feed into the core of Fanoos.

This write-up describes some thoughts, implementations, and conducted

start" of D Bayani's work relating to Fanoos was certainly no later than this 
(see the notes in the document listed under the manifest item with UUID

that preceded this). Note that this document contains result-types that were not
adopted in Fanoos (such as visual plots and "task agnostic" exploration of 
spaces), in addition to efforts that did feed into the core of Fanoos.

The document was write by D Bayani, who later emailed it to the people listed in
